# Beamalyzer

It is a full matlab-gui finite element program for solving 3D-Structure comprising of Beams with capabilities of visual preprocessing and post processing capabilities. 
A couple of example input file are given in Example folder
Some of the cool features of the program are :-

	* This program can take concentrated loads as well as distributed loads on the beam. 
	* Entering input variables is quite simple and is self-guidable once you start Bemalyzer program.
	* One can also directly load a input file and analyz the results visualially in the same program
	* It has both visual preprocessing and post processing capabilities. You can visualize the mesh as well as the analysis results.
	* It can also draw Bending Moments, Shear Force and Deflection diagrams of selected beams.
